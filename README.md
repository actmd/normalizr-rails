# Normalizr::Rails

Rails wrapper for normalizr JavaScript library (https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr). The version number of this gem follows the version number of the original JavaScript library.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'normalizr-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install normalizr-rails

## Usage

Add the following code to ``application.js``:
```
//= require normalizr
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
